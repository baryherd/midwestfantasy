The 2020 NFL season is here! Tonight kicks off the season with a playoff rematch between the Houston Texans and the Kansas City Chiefs. And with the kickoff, at least 2 QBs, 2 RBs, 2 WRs, 1 TE and 1 kicker will be locked into lineups.  While many of you will be watching from the sidelines (or not watching, or not reading this, or you didn’t even know you had a team [Grant]) I’m excited to see how my shiny new RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire performs. The last time a Chiefs rookie running back took the stage in a Week 1 prime time game, Kareem Hunt torched the Patriots for 246 total yards and 3 total touchdowns. CEH did pretty dang well against the Texans already. Here’s to hoping the new guy can do even better than Hunt.

With football comes a return to fantasy football. And with a return to fantasy football comes the return of The Commissioner’s Ridiculously Accurate Power Rankings (The CRAPR). This year, the weekly CRAPR will aim to point out each team’s strongest asset(s) while also shining light on the darker areas of everyone’s rosters. I appreciate positivity and will give credit where credit is due for those of you who took a good #2 (RB). 

Let’s go.

## THE NOT WINNERS DIVISION

_The Not Winners Division is composed of the bottom 7 teams from last year’s league. As is usually the case, several teams from this division will return to the postseason while many others will languish here like Reading or Nottingham Forest, always hoping to break through to the big time._

**7. My Mom Saved Eric’s Life (Matt R)**
_2019: 715.8 Total Points (13th), 4-9 Record (T-11th)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92783496-6fbe1580-f36b-11ea-93df-e6a1ec4010f9.png)

I will give Matt credit for one thing – he’s a man of consistency. He keeps bringing back Drew Brees year after year (and Brees is good!). Similarly, he keeps finding ways to make the commissioner’s job difficult year after year. The last minute attempts to get into drafts are basically part of my regularly scheduled commissioner duties at this point.

Eric’s Life has some receivers with solid floors – OBJ will get passes thrown his way and Jamison Crowder will garner plenty of passes in the Jets offense without much else to speak for. Darren Waller should be a top 10 TE in the Raiders offense again. Between the receivers, Drew Brees, and some shrewd RB management there is a path to the playoffs for Matt.

That said, there’s a few too many negatives here. The running backs have the explosiveness of a giant panda that just ate 40 pounds of bamboo. While Melvin Gordon, David Johnson and Adrian Peterson were both excellent in their primes, injuries and age have sapped them of their peak prowess.

Between below average running backs and an almost complete lack of depth at WR, I expect Matt to finish with the fewest points scored in the league.

**6. Angelslo Angry Anglers (Grant)**
_2019: 713.8 Total Points (14th), 7-6 Record (T-5th)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92823479-f5a18700-f392-11ea-81c2-19283e5472c8.png)

Grant pulled off one of the greatest terrible seasons in league history last year, parlaying a league low in points into a winning record. His games last year were the lowest scoring in the league as he faced the fewest total points against also. That kind of point luck is far from repeatable though, so scoring points is the goal for Grant this year.

A quarterback in Kliff Kingsbury’s offense might be able to help with that. Kyler Murray is primed to improve significantly this year and the addition of DeAndre Hopkins will hopefully help him to that. On top of the QB, Grant may have the league’s best trio of wide receivers in Julio Jones, Kenny Golladay and DK Metcalf. A world certainly exists where Murray is a top 3 QB and each of those receivers finishes in the top 12 or 15 of WRs.

Running back is a problem though. Running out Raheem Mostert and following that up with David Montgomery as a top RB is a problem, and one only exacerbated by having almost no RB depth on the bench (Chris Thompson should regularly score but won’t blow anyone away). Additionally, the floor at QB is also low. Murray posted scores of 8, 8, 10, 10 and 12 in his last 5 games last year. That kind of production from such a highly drafted QB is worrisome.

All told, there will probably be weeks this year where Murray and the WRs prop up the team to the tune of 70-80 points, but the floor is low enough that Grant likely will finish near the bottom of the league in points scored again.

**5. The Rural Juror (Roberta)**
_2019: 788.4 Total Points (T-9th), 4-9 Record (T-11th)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92824049-9132f780-f393-11ea-8921-5a11cc1f0397.png)

The graph above paints a scary picture of the last 7 years for Roberta. One playoff season in the first 5 of her tenure in the league was followed by finishes of 7th, 6th and 5th from 2011 to 2013. Then a slow decline began right around the time her kids began to talk. Correlation doesn't mean causation but try disproving that one.

Roberta's chances this year again lay in the hands of [one of the best QBs in the league](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/14876/ryan-tannehill) and also her starter, Deshaun Watson. The receiving corps here is unspectacular yet effective. Allen Robinson finished as the 10th highest scoring WR last year and AJ Green could be similarly good with Joe Burrow replacing Andy Dalton. If the Titans continue to block well for Derrick Henry, Roberta could find a place in the playoffs.

Things won't be easy for the Juror to make the playoffs though. There's a big question mark in her lineup at the second running back spot with Kareem Hunt. While there are several RBs on this roster, all but Henry sit 2nd on their own teams' depth charts. Additionally, the unspectacular nature of her WRs could also be her undoing, as the floor for Robinson, Green and Cooks could all be impacted by injury or poor QB play.

Naturally, it would be good if these power rankings did not start with three Ryherds in the bottom spot, but the commissioner calls a spade a spade. With the right mix of one of the Rural Juror's RBs breaking out and the WR meeting expectations, perhaps this spade will be the ace.

**4. Favre From Retiring (Jeff)**
_2019: 801.6 Total Points (8th), 6-7 Record (9th)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92823572-0fdb6500-f393-11ea-94c6-b39f14c07d34.png)

Jeff has had his fair share of down years in recent past (and one VERY good year). Last year was more of the same. His 9th place finish was typical of him over the last few years. Perhaps expelling Leonard Fournette to the trash heap is the kind of change that pushes Jeff back into the playoffs.
Jeff’s pickup of Miles Sanders late in the season last year was fruitful. Sanders was projected as a 1st rounder going into this year and Jeff has him as a 9th round pick. Additionally, Jeff sent a 4th rounder to Michael for DJ Moore and kept him too. In the draft Jeff stockpiled wide receivers (Davante Adams, Mike Evans, AND Tyler Lockett [we call him TRADE BAIT]) and shouldn’t have any issues at the position this year. If those wide receivers boom along with another top 5 finish from Russ, Jeff might be cooking with playoff spices.

But, like, Jeff has 2 RBs on his roster. TWO. And one of them might not even be the starter on his own team. That's not necessarily a problem but the chances of this not being a problem are <1%. In attempting to identify two strengths and two weaknesses for each team, I wrote "2nd running back" for Retiring and then "just running back in general" after that. That's where things are for Jeff. Things aren't impossible for him, but Zack Moss needs to be a hit and Jeff needs to find some help on waivers. 

It's within the realm of possibility that Jeff succeeds at this plan, but the last few years say that isn't likely. Perhaps he can spend some of that time away from work planning how to make this happen.

**3. Chapel Hill Champs (Dennis)**
_2019: 806 Total Points (7th), 4-9 Record (T-11th)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92848054-77071280-f3af-11ea-9dea-7b3849f372da.png)

Dennis has had an odd numbered finish in the league each of the last 10 years. While none of those resulted in a championship he does have 5 playoff appearances over that time to talk about. 

This year the Champs bring back DeAndre Hopkins again, although now he's in Arizona instead of Houston. The receivers are the strength of Dennis's team as he also has Jarvis Landry (perennially underrated) and Juju Smith-Schuster. Dennis's RBs aren't too shabby either, at least in terms of potential. Mark Ingram finished 6th in points last year and Ronald Jones is on America's New Favorite Team (the Buccaneers) and could provide some big points if their offense meets their high expectations.

Conversely, there's a potential for issues with Dennis's QBs. Both Roethlisberger and Cam Newton are coming of elbow and foot injuries. And while I like the "not too flashy" names at running back, there is a low floor here where Ronald Jones loses carries to Leonard Fournette and Mark Ingram cedes work to JK Dobbins. 

While those are concerns, there's a reason the Champs of Chapel Hill are ranked 3rd in the division - there's quality at every position here and a chance to make it back into the 3rd or 5th overall regular season standings.

**2. Hold Me Closer Tony Danza (Eric)**
_2019: 775.2 Total Points (12th), 3-10 Record (14th)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92850496-1cbb8100-f3b2-11ea-9f8a-632059c22cc5.png)

That ... is a bad trend. Make a line from the first three seasons to the most recent and things don't look great for Eric. But hey, if you finish 14th, you can't get any worse.

Right?

Well team Danza is set for a good year. Starting at running back, Eric has two RBs who finished last year in the top 12 and seem poised to do so again. Anytime someone has a couple top RBs their chances of being in the upper part of the standings already starts high. Add in Dak (finished as the 3rd highest scoring QB last year) and there's potential for a very high finish this year. Four lottery ticket running backs could turn up big returns as well.

Those wide receivers though. A bit rough there. McLaurin and Sanders are fine, but they finished outside the top 20 last year and this is certainly a position that could hinder success for Eric. If those WRs don't perform well and Dalvin Cook either holds out or gets injured then team Danza could find himself looking up at the league leaders again.

The core is there. Some good management (find a wide receiver quickly!) and health for Cook should be enough to get Eric back into the playoffs for the first time since 2015.

**1. Mega Man Dalarion (Brian)**
_2019: 787.2 Total Points (11th), 5-8 Record (10th)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92855791-4d9eb480-f3b8-11ea-9c72-54b0c8d0ff1c.png)

After a five year playoff run that culminated in consecutive championship defeats, Brian returned to the dark place that is not the playoffs. One hopes this isn't a repeat of the 2009-2013 playoff drought.

Our commissioner does not think it is such a return. In trading a 4th round pick for Kenyan Drake and drafting Clyde Edwards-Helaire (he looked good Thursday!) Brian has two pre-season top-12 running backs (Eric and Brian doing this well). On top of that, he kept some solid WRs in AJ Brown and Marquise Brown (hereby known as the Browns) and also took Amari Cooper, Cooper Kupp and Will Fuller in the first several rounds of the draft. That is some DEPTH.

With that wide receiver depth comes a lack of depth at running back though. Team Dalorian has only two other running backs, and they're either a 2nd string rookie or a Jaguar. Neither is ideal. Add that to a below average quarterback situation (Wentz did finish 9th last year!) and there's certainly a possibility for struggles here.

All things considered, the commissioner feels really good about a return trip to the playoffs for Brian. He's an admirable drafter, shrewd manager and truly, his combined use of compassion and statistics as the league manager are without parallel.

## THE WINNERS DIVISION

_The Winners Division is composed of the top 7 teams from last year’s league. As is usually the case, several teams from this division will return to the postseason while many others will fall from grace quickly like the Kansas City Royals or the Jacksonville Jaguars._

**7. Spuds MacKenzie (Derek)**
_2019: 788.4 Total Points (T-9th), 7-6 Record (T-5th)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92930013-14416580-f407-11ea-9d04-ea2c78c4f4ba.png)

Derek's last 5 years consisted of 4 top half finishes, 3 playoff appearances and a championship. That's gold, Jerry! His 2016 championship team is gone though, and with it go his cheap Le'Veon Bell and David Johnson contracts.

In its place is a 2020 team that even the real Spuds MacKenzie might growl at. While the receivers on Derek's team are among the best in the Midwest (Tyreek Hill - Calvin Ridley - Zach Ertz - John Brown is a quality fourtet). On top of them, Derek obtained Matt Ryan in the 6th round. The Atlanta QB has finished as the number 2 at his position twice in the last 4 years. If he does it again then Spuds will be good.

On the flip side, Matt Ryan has also finished 12th and 15th at QB in those other two years. That downside combined with running backs with low floors (the Colts announced they were planning on having Jonathan Taylor back up Marlon Mack) and this season could be a return to the bottom for Derek.

While Spuds has some risk at running back and is obviously listed as the lowest amongst the Winners Division, the roster here is in the middle of the pack and in position for a wild card spot.

**6. Real Men of Genius (David)**
_2019: 922.4 Total Points (3rd), 10-3 Record (2nd)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92946729-a3a54380-f41c-11ea-9481-5adb6c5506b7.png)

Betting against David based on the above: bold.

Betting against Patrick Mahomes: bold. Mahomes is the best QB in the league and most likely to be the highest scorer in our fantasy league.

Betting against Michael Thomas: bold. Thomas led the league in catches last year and is most likely to do the same again.

On top of that, David has Josh Jacobs locked in as his RB1, which is pretty solid given the QB and top WR he holds.

Yet here we are. Placing the Real Men of Genius 6th in the division. What gives?

Well folks, it's basically everything outside of those positions. As a prior holder of Devin Singletary, the commissioner advised that it doesn't seem like the Bills are completely in love with him (see Retiring, Favre From). Antonio Gibson is the hot name but he plays for Washington. So not the greatest at the RB position after Jacobs. The receivers though? Well, similar story. The Cardinals brought in DeAndre Hopkins which moves Christian Kirk down the pecking order. TJ Hockensen had 13 fantasy points in his debut game last year. Then he scored 19 points ... the rest of the entire season. Mecole Hardman appears to be roughly the 5th or 6th option in the Chiefs attack.

This may well be the spiciest take in the power rankings and certainly one that David himself may scoff at. There are cracks in the Genius foundations that may just yield a 4th ever season for him outside of the playoffs.

**5. KC Crazy Klepto Cosmonauts (Lee)**
_2019: 868.4 Total Points (6th), 8-5 Record (T-3rd)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92952051-f256db80-f424-11ea-956d-cf4dd335a01f.png)

Lee's highs are the highest (4 championships in 15 years) and his lows are some of the lowest (4 times in the bottom 3 of the league [that's more than Jeff]). That variance seems much more palpable than consistently finishing middle-high but never breaking through (see Champs, Chapel Hill or Son, It's a Tie). What will it be for the Cosmonauts this year?

Start at running back. Lee brings back Alvin Kamara (a commissioner's gift) and Todd Gurley (kind of a commissioner's gift?). Add the appropriately rated Chris Carson to the fold (perhaps underrated as he finished 10th in points last year) and the always solid James White and that's a quality running back team. The wide receivers are also good (Godwin was 2nd in points last year, Keenan Allen was 13th) and there's plenty of upside toward another championship run.

There is a floor problem though. Each of Kamara and Gurley had injury issues last year. Allen could be held back by the change of QB from Rivers to Tyrod Taylor. Matt Stafford is in the good-not-great area of the QB field. If Stafford gets hurt, Lee's backup is Baker Mayfield (a commissioner favorite) who underwhelmed last year after much hype.

The pieces are there for another high variance season. But that's a good thing. The goal of fantasy football is to win, not be average. Lee's history of blasting home run seasons followed by flaming out puts him in the record books, while others wallow in the sty of anonymity. 

**4. It's a Tie Son (Tom)**
_2019: 878.4 Total Points (5th), 7-6 Record (T-5th)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92953639-b2ddbe80-f427-11ea-9084-9519677690a2.png)

Tom remains as close to the Buffalo Bills of our league as one can get. His nine playoff appearances in 15 years are among the most in the league and he has two championship appearances to boot. Alas, he lives in the world of champion free managers (whom among us?). Last year he ran into the Lamar Jackson / Christian McCaffrey juggernaut in the semi finals and is going to be looking for revenge this year.

Son's roster starts with a commissioner favorite - two top 15 running backs (the threshold here varies based on the manager. The commissioner likes all good running backs). Saquon Barkley is a bona fide stud and James Conner is no slouch. The receivers look ready to shine also. George Kittle is part of the TE1a and TE1b pair with Travis Kelce and Courtland Sutton / Robert Woods and his two Giants receivers are all business without the accolades (Sutton perhaps not). If there's a quarterback who is due some positive regression it's Jared Goff who was 3rd in the league in passing yards yet only managed 22 TDs.

But Goff might not see that positive regression. It's possible his peak was a couple years ago and the novelty of the Sean McVay passing attack just might not cut it anymore. And speaking of QBs, Courtland Sutton is relying on perhaps the worst starting QB in the NFL while Robert Woods is catching passes from the aforementioned Goff.

If Barkley and Conner stay healthy and Le'Veon Bell returns to his Pittsburgh level of play, Tom's team will be a force this year.

One note: Tom is the only member of the league to have never lived in Iowa, yet is the only one with both an Iowa State Cyclone and an Iowa Hawkeye on his team. This excludes Michael's team whose Bills defense has one of each.

**3. LUG NUT (Matt C)**
_2019: 910.4 Total Points (4th), 7-6 Record (T-5th)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92955628-1e755b00-f42b-11ea-9284-fde03761b1dc.png)

Matt still has the greatest 3-year run in league history and that likely won't change for a while. The best record for each year, over 940 points every season and two championships. Truly, he is to our league what Texas football circa mid-2000s was to the Big 12 conference.

And much like Texas football there's always hype for LUG NUT! Aaron Jones. Nick Chubb. Gronk! Note the two top tier running backs. You know why Matt's team is in this spot. The commissioner fallacy of always getting heart eyes for fantastic runners. Those runners took Matt to the championship game last year, only to be tossed aside by his former college roommate. The floor that NUT's WRs provide is solid - both Thielen and Diggs should garner plenty of targets (Thielen because he's the last man standing and Diggs because Buffalo isn't trading a 1st for a guy they don't plan to target).

But also like Texas football a world of catastrophic mediocrity exists for LUG NUT. For one, Kirk Cousins is less than spectacular. For two, Kirk Cousins is pretty average as a fantasy QB. And for three, Thielen might be getting old and now Stefon Diggs has to catch passes from an inaccurate QB in Josh Allen. Nick Chubb might not even be the best running back on his own team and Aaron Jones just watched the Packers draft another running back in the second round of this year's draft.

Even if those running backs cede time to younger or better running backs as the season progresses, LUG NUT will likely put up enough wins early on to make another postseason run.

**2. Santa Fe Diablos (Jason)**
_2019: 971.2 Total Points (2nd), 11-2 Record (1st)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92958381-c0974200-f42f-11ea-97e8-ca7cbc2b418d.png)

Jason is doing a "reverse Eric" with his trend upward. Five bottom-4 finishes in his first eight seasons followed by a sharp rise over the last few years finally brought Jason into contender discussion. 

That rise coincided with the initial acquisition of Ezekiel Elliott. Zeke's perennial position as a top-5 running back paired with Travis Kelce's 1,000 yards per season has Los Diablos in a good position going into 2020. Add in some quality receivers in TY Hilton (a perfect fit with Philip Rivers in Indianapolis), Sterling Shepard and Julian Edelman and Jason is in a comfortable spot.

![](https://media1.tenor.com/images/a8996719f2257c44252201225330d8b1/tenor.gif)

But don't get too comfortable! Zeke has been injury prone the last few years and advanced analytics show that Tony Pollard might even be a better running back. Jason's second running back is Leonard Fournette. The commissioner has incredibly strong feelings about Leonard Fournette's effectiveness. And, as Jason well knows, TY Hilton had a fragile season last year and it could very easily happen again. Oh, and Josh Allen is a not-good-quarterback-who-is-a-good-fantasy-QB and if the wheels fall off there Jason will need to manage that in a hurry.

Things are looking bright for the Demons from St. Iron. Is this the year he can finally break through with a championship?

**1. The Real Awesome-O (Michael)**
_2019: 1088.4 Total Points (1st), 8-5 Record (T-3rd)_

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60373980/92959593-b8400680-f431-11ea-8710-ceb21ec25af7.png)

Let's keep this short. Michael's team is awesome. He finishes in the top 3 as often as he finishes anywhere else. He has the best running back in fantasy football and a top-2 quarterback too. He added Austin Ekeler and some good wide receiver options to a team that also has Mark Andrews. Clearly, a team like this can't fail. Good season everyone. Congrats on the 2020 championship, Michael.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6fIUOohyg4yegu1G/giphy.gif)

Michael's top wide receiver is a JACKSONVILLE JAGUAR. His RB2 has Tyrod Taylor at QB and his RB3 is listed as RB3 on his own team's depth chart! McCaffrey probably declines a bit (because it would be very hard to maintain that productivity more than anything). Do you feel that? Ah yes, the cracks in the foundation. Don't get cozy, Michael.

But for real, if Michael doesn't make the playoffs it would be a surprise.
