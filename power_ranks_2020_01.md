The 2020 NFL season is here! Tonight kicks off the season with a playoff rematch between the Houston Texans and the Kansas City Chiefs. And with the kickoff, at least 2 QBs, 2 RBs, 2 WRs, 1 TE and 1 kicker will be locked into lineups.  While many of you will be watching from the sidelines (or not watching, or not reading this, or you didn’t even know you had a team [Grant]) I’m excited to see how my shiny new RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire performs. The last time a Chiefs rookie running back took the stage in a Week 1 prime time game, Kareem Hunt torched the Patriots for 246 total yards and 3 total touchdowns. Here’s to hoping the new guy can do even better.

With football comes a return to fantasy football. And with a return to fantasy football comes the return of The Commissioner’s Ridiculously Accurate Power Rankings (The CRAPR). This year, the weekly CRAPR will aim to point out each team’s strongest asset(s) while also shining light on the darker areas of everyone’s rosters. I appreciate positivity and will give credit where credit is due for those of you who took a good #2 (RB). 
Let’s go.
THE NOT WINNERS DIVISION
The Not Winners Division is composed of the bottom 7 teams from last year’s league. As is usually the case, several teams from this division will return to the postseason while many others will languish here like Reading or Nottingham Forest, always hoping to break through to the big time.
7. My Mom Saved Eric’s Life (Matt R)
2019: 715.8 Total Points (13th), 4-9 Record (T-11th)
I will give Matt credit for one thing – he’s a man of consistency. He keeps bringing back Drew Brees year after year (and Brees is good!). Similarly, he keeps finding ways to make the commissioner’s job difficult year after year. The last minute attempts to get into drafts are basically part of my regularly scheduled commissioner duties at this point.
Eric’s Life has some receivers with solid floors – OBJ will get passes thrown his way and Jamison Crowder will garner plenty of passes in the Jets offense without much else to speak for. Darren Waller should be a top 10 TE in the Raiders offense again. Between the receivers, Drew Brees, and some shrewd RB management there is a path to the playoffs for Matt.
That said, there’s a few too many negatives here. The running backs have the explosiveness of a giant panda that just ate 40 pounds of bamboo. While Melvin Gordon, David Johnson and Adrian Peterson were both excellent in their primes, injuries and age have sapped them of their peak prowess.
Between below average running backs and an almost complete lack of depth at WR, I expect Matt to finish with the fewest points scored in the league.
6. Sioux City Siouxlanders (Grant)
2019: 713.8 Total Points (14th), 7-6 Record (T-5th)
Grant pulled off one of the greatest terrible seasons in league history last year, parlaying a league low in points into a winning record. His games last year were the lowest scoring in the league as he faced the fewest total points against also. That kind of point luck is far from repeatable though, so scoring points is the goal for Grant this year.
A quarterback in Kliff Kingsbury’s offense might be able to help with that. Kyler Murray is primed to improve significantly this year and the addition of DeAndre Hopkins will hopefully help him to that. On top of the QB, Grant may have the league’s best trio of wide receivers in Julio Jones, Kenny Golladay and DK Metcalf. A world certainly exists where Murray is a top 3 QB and each of those receivers finishes in the top 12 or 15 of WRs.
Running back is a problem though. Running out Raheem Mostert and following that up with David Montgomery as a top RB is a problem, and one only exacerbated by having almost no RB depth on the bench (Chris Thompson should regularly score but won’t blow anyone away). Additionally, the floor at QB is also low. Murray posted scores of 8, 8, 10, 10 and 12 in his last 5 games last year. That kind of production from such a highly drafted QB is worrisome.
All told, there will probably be weeks this year where Murray and the WRs prop up the team to the tune of 70-80 points, but the floor is low enough that Grant likely will finish near the bottom of the league in points scored again.
