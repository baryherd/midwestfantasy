# Week 3


### **Santa Fe Diablos (Jason)** squeaks by Spuds MacKenzie (Derek)
This could easily come down to Monday where Jason has Travis Kelce and Spuds has Tyreek Hill. If it does then Los Diablos are the choice as the Ravens shut down wide receivers. 

### **The Real Awesome-O (Michael)** defeats LUG Nut (Matt C)
Championship rematch! With McCaffrey injured Michael's team is less like the 1990s Bulls and more like the 2010s Bulls (McCaffrey being Derrick Rose). I'll still pick the guy who is not starting Mitch Trubisky. 

### It's a Tie Son (Tom) starts a string of defeats against **KC Crazy Clepto Cosmonauts (Lee)**
Kittle
Sutton
Barkley

Three players kept by Tom. Three players injured in two weeks. 

The lesson? Never keep players.

### Mega Man Dalorian (Brian) loses to **Favre from Retiring (Jeff)**
Favre from Retiring has the superior QB (Russ vs Tannehill) and receivers (Adams and Evans vs Cooper and Fuller) here. Jeff is the easy choice. 

### **No-Talent Ass-Clown (Eric)** easily handles Real Men of Genius (David)
The only person who replied negatively to the commissioner's preseason rankings was David. David is 0-2. Strange.

### The Rural Juror (Roberta) loses to **Courscant Corny Corpses (Grant)/88
Roberta's receivers' luck is putrid. Both Allen Robinson and AJ Green receive heavy target volume, but the production isn't there. If the volume continues, production will improve. I'll still take Grant though.

### **My Mom Saved Eric's Life (Matt R)** obtains a victory against Chapel Hill Champs (Dennis)
The battle of the bearded QBs and whatever it is these two are doing at running back. I just like that both of Dennis's RBs are "so-and-so II". One could build a solid team of Jr. and II and III and even V (thanks Will Fuller).

*Last week: 5-2; Season total: 5-2*
