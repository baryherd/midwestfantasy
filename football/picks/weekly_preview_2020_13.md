Welcome to the final week of the 2020 regular season! We made it, thankfully. We made it. To preview the final week of the season, I'll walk through teams who have clinched playoff spots, teams still playing for a playoff spot, seeding scenarios, and draft pick scenarios for 2021. I'll also take a look at potential keepers for each team based on the current state of things.

#### Favre From Retiring (Jeff) 10-2

Playoff odds: 100%

Most likely seed: 1, 100% chance

Jeff will look to go deep into the playoffs with his second playoff appearance since 2010 (it's been bad for him). In 2017 Jeff lost in the semi-finals as the top overall seed to a 4th seeded team led by Brian. Jump to 2020, and Jeff has clinched the top seed and Brian has a 27% chance of claiming the 4th seed. The commissioner approves.

Potential keepers: Miles Sanders (2021 7th Rd pick), Justin Jefferson (9), Davante Adams (1)

#### KC Crazy Klepto Cosmonauts (Lee) 8-4

Playoff odds: 100%

Most likely seed: 2, >99.9% chance

Lee is heading to the playoffs for the 4th straight year, but is looking to clinch a bye for the first time since 2012. Lee has never been the #2 seed, so this will likely be new. While Lee hasn't TECHNICALLY clinched the bye, it would take a loss, a win by Jason, and Jason outscoring Lee by 73 points to make it happen. While possible, it's not likely.

Potential keepers: Alvin Kamara (3), Keenan Allen (2), maybe Cole Beasley (9)

#### The Rural Juror (Roberta) 7-5

Playoff odds: >99.9%

Most likely seed: 3, 66.4% chance

Roberta finally returns to the playoffs (again, TECHNICALLY she hasn't clinched but a lot would need to happen, including being outscored by a lot (A LOT) of point). Her last appearance was in 2013. While she will likely be the #3 seed and face the #6 seed, her other two most likely finishes are 4th and 5th.

Potential keepers: Derrick Henry (1), Deshaun Watson (1), maybe Joshua Kelley if he is the starter in LAC (10)

#### Santa Fe Diablos (Jason) 7-5

Playoff odds: 99.7%

Most likely seed: 4, 42.3% chance

Jason has basically clinched, but if he loses and Brian and Matt R win AND either Michael or Tom win and outscore Jason by about 60, then he'll miss the playoffs. So not likely. Jason's range of outcomes mostly falls between the 3rd and 5th seed with about a 9% chance of getting the 6th seed.

Potential keepers: Travis Kelce (1), Robby Anderson (10), Miles Gaskin (9)

#### Mega Man Dalorian (Brian) 6-6

Playoff odds: 78.2%

Most likely seed: 4, 27.1% chance

This is where things start to get interesting. About 58% of the 78% odds of making the playoffs include a win over Grant in week 13. The other 20% of simulations include enough of the other 6-6 teams ALSO losing that I get in based on points scored for the season. 

As an aside, before this year 16 teams have started the season 0-4. None have made the playoffs. I started 0-4 this season.

Potential keepers: AJ Brown (7), Justin Herbert (9), James Robinson (9), Will Fuller (3)
