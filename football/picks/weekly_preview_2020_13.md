Welcome to the final week of the 2020 regular season! We made it, thankfully. We made it. To preview the final week of the season, I'll walk through teams who have clinched playoff spots, teams still playing for a playoff spot, seeding scenarios, and draft pick scenarios for 2021. I'll also take a look at potential keepers for each team based on the current state of things.

#### Favre From Retiring (Jeff) 10-2

Playoff odds: 100%

Most likely seed: 1, 100% chance

Jeff will look to go deep into the playoffs with his second playoff appearance since 2010 (it's been bad for him). In 2017 Jeff lost in the semi-finals as the top overall seed to a 4th seeded team led by Brian. Jump to 2020, and Jeff has clinched the top seed and Brian has a 27% chance of claiming the 4th seed. The commissioner approves.

Potential keepers: Miles Sanders (2021 7th Rd pick), Justin Jefferson (9), Davante Adams (1)

#### KC Crazy Klepto Cosmonauts (Lee) 8-4

Playoff odds: 100%

Most likely seed: 2, >99.9% chance

Lee is heading to the playoffs for the 4th straight year, but is looking to clinch a bye for the first time since 2012. Lee has never been the #2 seed, so this will likely be new. While Lee hasn't TECHNICALLY clinched the bye, it would take a loss, a win by Jason, and Jason outscoring Lee by 73 points to make it happen. While possible, it's not likely.

Potential keepers: Alvin Kamara (3), Keenan Allen (2), maybe Cole Beasley (9)

#### The Rural Juror (Roberta) 7-5

Playoff odds: >99.9%

Most likely seed: 3, 66.4% chance

Roberta finally returns to the playoffs (again, TECHNICALLY she hasn't clinched but a lot would need to happen, including being outscored by a lot (A LOT) of point). Her last appearance was in 2013. While she will likely be the #3 seed and face the #6 seed, her other two most likely finishes are 4th and 5th.

Potential keepers: Derrick Henry (1), Deshaun Watson (1), maybe Joshua Kelley if he is the starter in LAC (10)

#### Santa Fe Diablos (Jason) 7-5

Playoff odds: 99.7%

Most likely seed: 4, 42.3% chance

Jason has basically clinched, but if he loses and Brian and Matt R win AND either Michael or Tom win and outscore Jason by about 60, then he'll miss the playoffs. So not likely. Jason's range of outcomes mostly falls between the 3rd and 5th seed with about a 9% chance of getting the 6th seed.

Potential keepers: Travis Kelce (1), Robby Anderson (10), Miles Gaskin (9)

#### Mega Man Dalorian (Brian) 6-6

Playoff odds: 78.2%

Most likely seed: 4, 27.1% chance

This is where things start to get interesting. About 58% of the 78% odds of making the playoffs include a win over Grant in week 13. The other 20% of simulations include enough of the other 6-6 teams ALSO losing that I get in based on points scored for the season. 

As an aside, before this year 16 teams have started the season 0-4. None have made the playoffs. I started 0-4 this season. I was one more loss away from blowing things up and selling for draft picks in 2021. Never give up.

Also note that both Jason's and my most likely playoff seed is 4th.

Potential keepers: AJ Brown (7), Justin Herbert (9), James Robinson (9), Will Fuller (3)

#### My Mom Saved Eric's Life (Matt R) 6-6

Playoff odds: 36.8%

Most likely finish: 7th, 30.1% chance

Here begins a group of four teams whose playoff odds are between 24.7% and 36.8%. Week 13 will be nuts. Matt's odds against Jeff in Week 13 sit at 32.5% (Jeff's team is very good). The rest of Matt's playoff odds rest on a slew of failures from the other 6-6 teams and also outscoring Eric by 25 points. Everything is on the table. About 90% of simulations have Matt between 5th and 8th.

Potential keepers: Nelson Agholor (9), Aaron Rodgers (6)

#### No-Talent Ass-Clown (Eric) 5-7

Playoff odds: 31.5%

Most likely finish: 6th, 24.1% chance

Eric's odds of winning this week are 58.5%. A win also gives Tom a loss, eliminating one of the 6-6 teams ahead of him. From there, he either needs Matt R and Michael to lose OR he needs one of those two to lose AND for me to lose AND to outscore me by 23 points. And that happens in a little more than half the simulations, bringing his 58.5% chance to win this week to a 31.5% chance to make the playoffs. Also note that Eric's second most likely finish is 7th (23.5% chance).

Potential keepers: Dalvin Cook (1), JK Dobbins (3), CeeDee Lamb (5)

#### It's A Tie Son (Tom) 6-6

Playoff odds: 27.4%

Most likely finish: 10th, 38.2% chance

If Eric's chances of beating Tom are 58.5%, then Tom's chances of winning this week are 41.5%. He still needs help from there. He's tied with Michael (4 points behind in standings), Matt R (69), and Brian (115) in the standings at 6-6. He could win this week and outscore Michael by 5 points and have one of either Matt or Brian lose to get in. Or he could win and BOTH Brian and Matt could lose. These events happen about 2/3rds of the time.

Tom's most likely finishes are 10th (38%) and 6th (18%).

Potential keepers: Chase Claypool (13!!!), Saquon Barkley, I guess (1)

#### The Real Awesome-O (Michael) 6-6

Playoff odds: 24.7%

Most likely finish: 9th, 46.7% chance

Michael's situation is nearly identical to Tom's but he has a lower chance of winning this week.

His most likely finishes are 9th (47%) and 6th (17%).

Potential keepers: Mark Andrews (7), Benny Snell (10), Damien Harris (9)

#### LUG NUT (Matt C) 5-7

Playoff odds: 1.6%

Most likely finish: 8th, 28.4% chance

Matt has a small outside chance of making the playoffs (1.6%). His easiest path is to:
(1) Win
(2) Matt R loses, outscore Matt R by 12
(3) Michael loses
(4) Tom loses, outscore Eric by 35

The other scenario has 2 of the final 3 things happen but replace the third with my team losing and Matt outscoring me by 57.

MORE likely than making the playoffs for Matt is losing and obtaining the 1st overall pick! He has a 2.1% chance of getting the first pick. Matt's range of outcomes is the largest of all teams: simulations have Matt anywhere from 14th all the way up to 5th.

Potential keepers: Nick Chubb (5), Tee Higgins (12), Aaron Jones (1)
