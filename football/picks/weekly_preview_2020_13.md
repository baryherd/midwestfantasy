Welcome to the final week of the 2020 regular season! We made it, thankfully. We made it. To preview the final week of the season, I'll walk through teams who have clinched playoff spots, teams still playing for a playoff spot, seeding scenarios, and draft pick scenarios for 2021. I'll also take a look at potential keepers for each team based on the current state of things.

#### Favre From Retiring (Jeff) 10-2

Playoff odds: 100%

Most likely seed: 1, 100% chance

Jeff will look to go deep into the playoffs with his second playoff appearance since 2010 (it's been bad for him). In 2017 Jeff lost in the semi-finals as the top overall seed to a 4th seeded team led by Brian. Jump to 2020, and Jeff has clinched the top seed and Brian has a 27% chance of claiming the 4th seed. The commissioner approves.

Potential keepers: Miles Sanders (2021 7th Rd pick), Justin Jefferson (9), Davante Adams (1)
