My face when I saw Mega Man Dalorian only get 4 total touchdowns in Week 1.

**14. It's a Tie Son (Tom)**
_0-1, 52.2 Total Points_

With injuries to Conner and Bell, Tom is left with a gaping hole at running back. Lazard might be a useful receiver after all.

**13. The Rural Juror (Roberta)**
_1-0, 52.4 Total Points_

Here we find the second lowest scorer of Week 1 at 1-0. Every Derrick Henry catch matters.

**12. My Mom Saved Ericâ€™s Life (Matt R)**
_1-0, 71 Total Points_

Much to the commissioner's chagrin, the running backs played fantastic. OBJ on the other hand...

**11. Belgian Bellowin Belles (Grant)**
_0-1, 83.6 Total Points_

Kyler Murray (91 rush yards) could be this year's Lamar Jackson. If so, the Belles are looking beautiful.

**10. Real Men of Genius (David)**
_0-1, 57 Total Points_

I'm not sure who wrote this recently but wow, good work:

_"There are cracks in the Genius foundations that may just yield a 4th ever season for him outside of the playoffs."_

**9. Chapel Hill Champs (Dennis)**
_0-1, 62 Total Points_

Ben (3 TDs) to Juju (6 catches, 2 TDs) paid dividends. The volume for Mark Ingram is a concern.

**8. Mega Man Dalarion (Brian)**
_0-1, 53.4 Total Points_

Wentz was dreadful, but there's promise on the horizon with a QB trade. It's Tannetime.

**7. No-Talent Ass-Clown (Eric)**
_0-1, 67.4 Total Points_

If not for a poor performance from Dak and Mixon this is a 1-0 team. With Sanders and Dobbins in line for more work, things will be okay.

**6. KC Crazy Klepto Cosmonauts (Lee)**
_1-0, 75 Total Points_

Some gaudy point totals from the RBs, but Gurley/Kamara/Carson combined for 32 carries for only 93 yards.

**5. Spuds MacKenzie (Derek)**
_1-0, 81 Total Points_

Derek swapped out Julio a couple seasons ago and appears to have timed things well in acquiring Calvin Ridley (9 catches, 130 yards, 2 TDs).

**4. Favre From Retiring (Jeff)**
_1-0, 80.6 Total Points_

No Miles Sanders? No problem when Russ (4 TDs) and Davante Adams (14 catches, 156 yards, 2 TDs) score 51.8 combined.

**3. LUG NUT (Matt C)**
_0-1, 74.2 Total Points_

Well the quarterback seemed just fine (thanks to some garbage time, which still counts). Is Malcolm Brown good enough to start now?

**2. Santa Fe Diablos (Jason)**
_1-0, 76 Total Points_

A steady dose of Josh Allen and Zeke will carry a team pretty far.

**1. The Real Awesome-O (Michael)**
_1-0, 85.8 Total Points_

Michael just cruising to victory while Grant puts up his second highest score in 5 years. Just mean.
